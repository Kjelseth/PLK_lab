\section{Part 1}
This Part is about making a structural coded counter using T-flip-flop instances and displaying the counted value on some 7-segment displays.


\subsection{Solving}
Solving this task was done by first making a T-flip-flop, as the task did not specify how this should be made, the choice of behavioural code was made. Then the counter was made as described in the task with structural code using eight instances of the T-flip-flop. The display component, code~\ref{Code:Part1_Display.vhd} and its decoder component, code~\ref{Code:Decoder.vhd} was copied from previous lab tasks. Then finally a TLE was made that simply connected the switches and button to the counter and connected the counter to the display.

\section{Part 2}
This is part is about making a similar circuit as part 1 but instead making it with a behavioural code and in 16-bit.


\subsection{Solving}
The behavioural code to make a simple resettable counter was so small that it was made inside the TLE. The statement supplied in the task combined with a simple if statement was enough to make the counter, then a similar pair for clearing the value was also made. instead of splitting the 16-bit number in two, the display component was slightly modified to accept a 16 bit number and use four instances of the decoder instead.

\subsection{RTL}
Figure~\ref{fig:p2_RTL_TLE} shows that this is implemented using two sets of comparators in series, the first for checking the enable and then count up using an adder each clock cycle. The second for checking the reset and replace the whole number with 0 if reset is low.

\end{figure}


\clearpage
\subsection{Results}
As read from figure~\ref{fig:p2_comp}, under "Logic utilization", this circuit uses a total of 23 logic elements to realize this configuration. Not much different from the structural code in part 1, especially since this is 16-bit and not 8-bit and twice the amount of 7-segment displays. An argument of this being more efficient/compact could be made, but there would be a better comparison if equal circuits were compared.

The pictures from the testing in figure~\ref{fig:p2_results} of this circuit are unfortunately very limited, but it was tested thoroughly off camera to ensure that it worked the way as the part 1 circuit, with the only change being compatibility for larger numbers.

\section{Part 3}
The purpose of this task was to learn how to use a counter to make a "slower clock" from fast clock.


\subsection{Solving}
The first thing to do for solving this kind of problem is some math. we know the following:

\begin{equation*}
    f_{clock} = 50\unit{MHz}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    f_{desired} = 1\unit{Hz}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    Ratio = \frac{50\unit{MHz}}{1\unit{Hz}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
    Ratio = 5,0 \cdot 10^7
    \label{eq:ratio}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    2^{25}< 5,0 \cdot 10^7 < 2^{26}
    \label{eq:scale}
\end{equation}


Instructions for this task was that it was good enough to make an approximate 1 second clock, as the purpose was to be able to see each clock cycle happen, in for example a counter. Using equation~\ref{eq:scale} shows that making a 25 or 26 bit counter to trigger the slower counter each time it resets would work for this approximation as these are the closest to the ratio found in equation~\ref{eq:ratio}. I don't think that was acuate enough so I choose to make a more precise 1 second clock. This means using a 26 bit counter and when it reaches the exact ratio value, the counter resets and counts up the slow clock.

\begin{equation}
    5,0 \cdot 10^7_{10} = 10\;1111\;1010\;1111\;0000\;1000\;0000_{2}
    \label{eq:exact}
\end{equation}

The binary value of the ratio was found in equation~\ref{eq:exact} and used to reset the counter. In addition the slow clock had a similar setup, instead of being a 4-bit counter that resets at decimal 15 it should only go from 0 to 9, therefore it resets once it hits 10. And there was also included both enable and reset switches to control wether the counter was active or not and if it should clear all counters. As this task only used a single 7-segment display, the decoder component was used directly.

\subsection{RTL}
figure~\ref{fig:p3_RTL_TLE} show that similar to part 2, it is a bunch of comparators,with some adders. It is kind of possible to see the 26 bit counter with comparators and the 4 bit counter with comparators and how they are connected. A pdf with a scalable graphic is in the \linkgithub{GitHub} at {\small\verb|[PLK_lab/Lab04/Extra/Part3_RTL_TLE.pdf]|} if studying the RTL closer is of interest.

\end{figure}


\clearpage
\subsection{Results}
As read from figure~\ref{fig:p3_comp}, under "Logic utilization", this circuit uses a total of 28 logic elements to realize this configuration. That is not a lot as it is dealing with a 26 bit number and a 4 bit number, both with multiple comparators.

A video of the counter counting would be the only true way to show how it functions. That can be found, also in the mentioned \linkgithub{GitHub} at {\small\verb|[PLK_lab/Lab04/Extra/Part3.mp4]|} if that is of interest. The pictures in figure~\ref{fig:p3_results} shows function but is limited.
