# Programmerbare logiske kretser
This is the repository where you can find all of the resources I used regarding the USN course PB1180 Programmerbare logiske kretser (Programmable Logic Circuits).

## Labs
Each lab task has it's own folder where the LaTeX report and its relevant files are. usually these will be within their own folders like this:
- Code    - for all VHDL code files or other codes that may be used
- Figures - for all pictures, screenshots and similar
- Affinity - for affinity photo files to used in photo editing
