# Programmerbare logiske kretser
This is the repository where you can find all of the resources I used regarding the USN course PB1180 Programmerbare logiske kretser (Programmable Logic Circuits).

## Licence
All files within this repository are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), allowing you to freely use, modify, and distribute the code for any purpose, provided you include the original license notice.

## Use
Do you want to use some of this material for your own course completion, feel free. Keep in mind that copy pasting the codes used or documents will not teach you anything about VHDL and it will be flagged as plagiarism and then you don't pass the course. That said, using this as an example solution or comparing to see why/how something works like it does is a good idea. If you just want a LaTeX sample document to use my styles you can look in the template folder this is a good blank slate with a big preamble for formating, it is well commented so it should be easy to customize if you like. Also feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the customization or use.

# LaTeX file
To use the LaTeX file you need to render it with LuaLaTeX, for example in overleaf, click on menu and under settings, compiler, choose LuaLaTeX.

## Structure
Each lab task has it's own folder where the LaTeX report and its relevant files are. usually these will be within their own folders like this:
- Code - for all VHDL code files or other codes that may be used
- Figures - for all pictures, screenshots and similar
- Affinity - for affinity photo files to used in photo editing
- Other - may be included in the future
